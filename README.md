# Building

## MSVC

You will need to install Ruby and Bison on your PC before building.

** note **

Do not use the Bison installer. Download the zip file and unzip it into a folder with no spaces in its path, and then add its bin folder to the PATH.

For building the x86 configuration you need to download nasm at https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds.

Then add the install location to PATH.

Open `build/msvc/a2.sln` with Visual Studio 2015 and build (Ctrl+Shift+B).

mruby is built in the pre-link section of a2
